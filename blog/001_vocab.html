  <h4>The Problem</h4>
  <br>
  Recently, I've been learning German and have found the experience of absorbing new vocabulary
  fairly frustrating. While German has a steep learning curve when it comes to vocab, I've found that most,
  if not all, currently available apps lack the thoughtful design needed for effective learning.
  <br><br>
  Searching for "learn German" right now on the app store presents you with two options:
  context-based app and repetition-based app.
  <br><br>
  Context-based apps like Duolingo try to introduce vocabulary in the context of daily speech or following certain
  themes. While
  these offer a more engaging experience, I find them very slow, and sometimes the methods used
  can be distracting (e.g., the mini-games in Duolingo).
  <br><br>
  On the other hand, flashcard apps like Anki allow users to create flashcards they can use to
  quickly review large amounts of vocabulary. However, the presentation of vocabulary is completely
  random and not based on how useful the words actually are.
  The ability to see and use a word as soon as you learn it is very powerful, in that it not only
  deepens your memory of that word, but also helps you understand its meaning and its connection to other
  words, thus strengthening your overall vocabulary skills.
  <br><br>
  I want something that allows me to learn vocabulary at a steady pace in a way that lets me immediately recognize words
  in daily
  conversations or books, without being too slow. The first app that somewhat worked is
  <a href="https://linguico.com/">Linguico</a>, which shows, in flashcard style, German
  and even some Swiss-German vocabulary sorted by frequency in natural language use. This allows
  the user to acquire the most useful vocab in the most streamlined way possible. But the downside with
  this app and many other flashcard apps is that they are completely passive and require
  the user to manually specify the difficulty of words.
  <br><br>
  <div class="imgframe">
    <img src="" alt="linguico screenshot"></img>
    <div class="imgdesc">A screenshot from the Linguico app</div>
  </div>
  <br>
  Above is an example from the vocab training section of Linguico. For every word, the user
  has to classify it as hard, medium, or easy. Hard words are then repeated many times
  within a session and will appear more often in later review sessions. Medium and easy words
  progressively have fewer repetitions and are also less likely to show up in
  later review sessions. This is a flawed mechanism because: 1. It is very passive 2. Users can't make accurate
  judgments
  about how difficult a word is 3. It's very punishing if the user makes a wrong assessment.
  <br><br>
  So, what can we learn from this?
  <br><br><br>
  <h4>My Solution</h4>
  <br>
  Here are the principles that guide my solution:
  <br><br>
  1. Leverage spaced repetition
  <br>
  2. Show words based on their frequency of use
  <br>
  3. Present words <b>in context</b> with example sentences
  <br>
  4. Require active input from the user
  <br>
  5. Personalize the review experience
  <br>
  6. Eliminate manual difficulty ranking
  <br>
  7. Create a tight feedback loop (<a href="https://youtu.be/M7eUE5ReCVQ?si=tJPnRH3fFs0H6XIi&t=278">Success Is Not About
    Trying Hard</a>)
  <br><br>
  Of these principles, the seventh is the most subtle yet critical.
  Context-based apps are slow at teaching vocabulary because their feedback loops are fragmented across
  different modes and exercises. Even within each exercise, the number of words shown is very limited.
  Similarly, Linguico's constant self-assessment prompts break the learning flow and prevent users from having more
  practice trials.
  <br><br>
  So, I've created a flashcard app that displays English words with example
  sentences showing their usage in context. Users must type out the German translation. Words are
  prioritized using a ranking algorithm that combines three factors: the word's usefulness, its frequency
  in natural language, and the severity of any previous mistakes the user made with that word.
